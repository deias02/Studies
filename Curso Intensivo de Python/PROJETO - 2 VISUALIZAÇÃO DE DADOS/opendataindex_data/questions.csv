open_licence,global,Is the data openly licensed/in public domain?,Openly licenced,"<p>This question measures if anyone is legally allowed to use, modify and redistribute data for any purpose. Only then data is considered truly &quot;open&quot; (see Open Definition). Answer ”Yes” if the data are openly licensed. The Open Definition provides a list of conformant licences. Answer also “Yes” if there is no open licence, but a statement that the dataset is in “public domain”. To count as public domain the dataset must not be protected by copyright, patents or similar restrictions. If you are not sure whether an open licence or public domain disclaimer is compliant with the Open Definition 2.1, seek feedback on the Open Data Index discussion forum.</p>

format,global,In which formats are the data?,In an open and machine-readable format,"<p>Tell us the file formats of the data. We automatically compare them against a list of file formats that are considered machine-readable and open. A file format is called machine-readable if your computer can process, access, and modify single elements in a data file. The Index considers formats to be “open” if they can be fully processed with at least one free and open-source software tool. The source code of these format does not have to be open. Potentially these formats allow more people to use the data, because people do not need to buy specific software to open it.</p>
